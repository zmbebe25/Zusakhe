For clarity of presentation, the ideas are developed within \nthe context of states of stress attainable with triaxial testing. The selection of stress and strain invariants \nadequate for the triaxial test is considered. The four main components of an elasto-plastic constitutive \nmodel are then introduced: Elasticity (limited to the isotropic case), yield surfaces, plastic potentials, \nand hardening rules. The interactions between these four components are illustrated using the Cam-clay \nconstitutive model and more recent CSSM-based models. Correlations between index properties and CSL \nparameters that allow preliminary estimations of CSLs are also presented.",

    "Description": "Architecture is not a mature field with a widely accepted underlying theory; thus; a number of approaches \nto architecture are presented. This depends on whether these are software; or hardware and the specific \ntype of hardware systems e.g. largely signal processing; like radar. Key to architecture is creativity; dealt \nwith in concept generation. Alternatives need to be generated both at the system level and at functionlevel. \nConcept generation is supported by behaviour analysis (part of which is functional analysis). \nThe course covers both the development of structural (physical) and behavioural aspects of architecting. \nConcepts relating to the development of alternatives; the evaluation of these and the selection of candidate \narchitectures; the issue of traceability from requirements; functions and allocation to system elements; the \nconcept of technical budgeting; supported by modelling and simulation and technology as the basis of \nany solution and the concept of technology maturity are presented.",

It is a form of \nenquiry that seemed out the intimate, the banal, the taken-for-granted and the relational as the vehicles \nfor understanding lifeworlds. This kind of research practice requires a sophisticated set of social and \nanalytical resources and can only be generated by prolonged, deep engagement with a field. It also \nrequires the production of what we call field notes, the recording practice central to the ethnographic \nmethod. The course will provide students with the opportunity to engage ethnography by reading some \nexcerpts of its classic iterations as well as following it into their directions it has been taken more recently; \nand to carry out multiple practical exercises in ethnographic research.",

One main focus of medical studies \nis relating a response variable to one or several explanatory variables. A traditional way of accomplishing \nthis is through a multiple linear regression model. However, model assumptions for linear regression may \nbe questionable because data might not be linearly related or normally distributed. For example, linear \nregression does not work when outcome data are counts or binary. Further, data may also be correlated when \nmeasurements are collected on the same individual. This course therefore provides an extension of the linear \nmodelling framework to allow non-linear response variables, hence, a generalisation of regression methods.",

The first case study covers the political and economic progress of China from the \n1400s until the 1990s, but especially focusing on China under Communist Party rule. The second looks \nat the historical processes that shaped the Middle East and its multiple connections to other parts of the \nworld, especially imperialism, the centrality of oil and the role of ruling elites and the spread of Islam. The \nthird study examines the space now known as Latin America, dealing with issues of ecology, disease and \nthe Columbian Exchange, the wars of independence and the Cold war period. The fourth case\nstudy examines Africa’s historical encounters with the rest of the world over many centuries, focusing \nparticularly on cultural exchange, hybridisation and diaspora.",

A central spine to the course is provided by a set of related questions about \nwhat impelled people to the towns and how they became fully urban. It examines the new cultures \nand identities, communities and political organisations which emerged in the multi-racial and multi-\nethnic urban melting pot. It explores the idea of ungovernability between the 1940s and 1980s and \nthe new laws and policies formulated (segregation, apartheid and post apartheid reform) to regulate and \nrepress these processes and forces.  It asks how central the cities were to understanding the more general \nprocesses of historical change in South Africa and the sub-continent.",

The course questions inherited periodisations of the past \nthat sharply divide the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial, and critique colonial and nationalist maps \nthat have paid little attention to alternative geographies created by the movement of people. Themes that \nemerge through seminars and readings include: colonial governmentality, resistant indigenous political \nand social philosophies, currents of capital and labour, religious networks, the conception of an Indian \nocean public sphere, movements for political freedom, development and modernity in the post colony, \nand various cosmopolitanisms that are rooted in the movement of people and ideas rather than the prison \nhouse of colony and nation.",

South Africa's early economic development is understood \nlargely in terms of its position as a historically mineral-rich capitalist economy shaped by colonialism and \napartheid. The evolution of the South African political economy is traced from the late 19th century to the \npresent. Various interpretations of South African development - including the Minerals-Energy Complex, \nimport substitution industrialisation, \u201cColonialism of a special type\u201d, and the Wolpean core-periphery \nconceptualisation of the economy - are interrogated. This foundation is used to explain how the contemporary \nstructure of the South African and why it has given rise to the persistence of issues such as extreme inequality, \npoverty, and unemployment. Throughout, attention is paid to the dynamics of race, class, and gender and \nhow these shaped South African development. The course emphasises interdisciplinary approaches and \ndraws on the mutually enriching contributions of various disciplines to develop an understanding of the \npolitical economy of South Africa. Students will engage with a variety of texts in order to develop rigorous \nquantitative and qualitative analytical skills, with a particular focus on writing.

    "Description": "Owing to its inherent complexity, tax law, which consists of statutory, constitutional and common-law \nrules, is based on an uneasy combination of legal concepts and economic outcomes. The complexity \nand artificiality of the tax system leads to conceptual difficulty and often places the interpretation of the \ntext in the hands of the judiciary. In addition, the new constitutional order has changed the traditional \nrules of interpretation. Under the influence of a Bill of Rights, South African courts have moved away \nfrom the continued application of the strict literal approach towards a purposive construction of \nlegislation, according to which the purpose or object of the legislation must be ascertained from the \nwords used in it, viewed in their proper context, and the legislation must then be interpreted in such \na way as to advance the purpose for which the provision in question was apparently enacted. The \nobjective of this course is to examine the progression in judicial attitudes to the interpretation of tax \nlegislation and to suggest a framework for discerning and articulating principles of interpretation.",

    "Description": "Tax law, which consists of statutory, common-law and constitutional rules, is a creature of statute. \nSometimes the words of the statute have a plain and straightforward meaning, but in many cases, \nthere is ambiguity or vagueness which leads to conceptual difficulty. This often requires the judiciary \nto construe the meaning of the legislative text, based on a textual interpretation not of the subjective \nintent of the legislature, but rather the objective intent that a reasonable person would gather from \nthe text of the law, placed alongside the remainder of the corpus juris. Context is important, and the \nnew constitutional order has changed the traditional rules of interpretation. Under the influence of a \nBill of Rights, South African courts have moved away from the continued application of the strict literal \napproach towards a purposive construction of legislation, according to which the purpose or object of \nthe legislation must be ascertained from the words used in it, viewed in their proper context; and the \nlegislation must then be interpreted in such a way as to advance the purpose for which the provision in \nquestion was apparently enacted. The objective of this course is to examine the progression in judicial \nattitudes to the interpretation of tax legislation and to suggest a framework for discerning and articulating \nprinciples of interpretation; and to contribute to a subtler and richer texture for statutory interpretation.",

    "Description": "This course explores different ideologies of development, and how such ideologies have underpinned \nSouth Africa’s developmental strategies in the democratic era and the recent National Development Plan. \nThe course examines what institutions of trade, investment, property, contract, and competition law are \nintegral to the achievement or undermining of this developmental vision and the extent to which these \ninstitutions may perpetuate environmental harm. The course will also examine recent statutory attempts to \noverride the regulatory model of environmental protection, most notably the Infrastructure Development \nAct 23 of 2014. The course finally examines the extent to which law is being used, or could be used, to \ngive effect to alternate forms of human development.",

The political environment affects all phases and most aspects of the public policy process, \nincluding policy content. The point of departure is that it is inappropriate to study public policy processes \nas if they are manifested in political voids; as if public policy is simply the outcome of ,for example, policy \nneeds, formulation skills, and capacity to implement. The course positions public policy as, to a significant \nextent, the outcome of complex political processes involving strategy, contestation, the political reading of \npublic needs, and leadership political will. The course argues that a thorough understanding of the multi-\nlayered political environment of public policy facilitates professional and developmentally effective policy \nand policy processes. In the deconstruction of \u2018political environment' the course emphasises, inter alia, \nthe policy-relevant contexts of national political debates and contestation, policy management as directed \nby the executive, the politics of inter-governmental relations, the politicisation of centres of bureaucratic \npower, community politics and contestation, and the impact of party and liberation politics on policy-\nmaking.

Thus, illustrating that \ncustomary law is neither a unified system of law nor is it territorial. It further examines the role of \nCustomary Law within the democratic system by evaluating its nature, status and sources. This course \nfurther examines how the development and practice of customary law was affected during the pre-colonial, \ncolonial and apartheid regimes in South Africa. It proceeds by examining the hlstorical Justification of \ncustomary rules, principles and remedies and demonstrates how some of them have been tested against \nthe Constitution of the Republic of South Act 108 of 1996. It further assesses how customary law regulates \ntraditional authority, property and land ownership, inequality and gender concerns, succession, marriage \nand witchcraft. It also examines the manner in which those who subscribe to customary law resolve \ntheir disputes. Students are expected to critically engage various rules, principles, remedies and African \ncustoms in order to understand the manner in which customary law has been developed by the courts in \nline with the Constitution.",

Specifically, the course will investigate the \nhistorical and contemporary scholarly and policy approaches to, and critiques of, statebuilding and its \nprecursor - \u2018state-making', reflecting upon regional and country perspectives and experiences. Alternative \napproaches emerging in policy, practice, and scholarship will be engaged, with consideration of what a \ndecolonized approach to statebuilding might entail. The course will also investigate how the state builds \nand retains legitimacy, and how competing sources of legitimacy and alternative societal systems can be \npeaceably accommodated for the forging of more robust and peaceful social contracts.",

While law primarily concerns \nitself with the institutions that govern some of the actions of a heterogeneous array of communities, \nassociations, sub-publics and individual citizens, ethical systems exhaust (or presume to exhaust) the \ncorrect decisions that an individual ought to make with respect to all actions that he or she undertakes. \nAt the same time, various ethical schools of thought inform the contours of various bodies of law. To \nunderstand ethics as a self-standing subject of study and ethics as it shapes the law, the course engages a \nnumber of schools of thought: Ubuntu, utilitarianism, deontology, African humanism, black consciousness, \nfeminist ethics, neo-Aristotelianism, relational ethics, development theory and the capabilities approach. \nWhile superficial readings of ethical schools often emphasise difference, deeper more radical readings of \nthese same ethical schools demonstrate how they often conduce toward one another.  315\nThe course then explores how these various ethical doctrines play themselves out in a range of practical \nlegal settings - from case law, legislation and the Constitution to the professional ethics of legal practitioners \nand members of the judiciary, as well as other legal actors.",

    "Description": "Archaeobotany is an interdisciplinary sub-field of archaeology that integrates botany, ecology and social \ntheory to address an extensive range of issues. This course will address the use of plants by past societies, \nthus it examines anciently-preserved archaeological plant remains. The materials include carbonized, \nmineralized or desiccated plant materials macrobotanical remains or plant macrofossils such as seeds, \nfruit, leaves, twigs, parenchyma tissues and tubers while microbotanical remains are in the form of pollen, \nphytoliths and starch residue. Other datasets include plant imprints in other supports such as pottery. \nThese plant remains come from distinctive genera or species and have specific environmental signatures. \nTherefore, apart from past plant use, this course will investigate the human-environmental relations, \nenvironmental changes and modifications as well as past cultural use of plants.",

    "Description": "This course focuses on the practical observational and data gathering skills and techniques needed to \nconduct advanced geological mapping, integrate results using a variety of geological techniques, and \nto report these results in a coherent way. The course builds on the Geological Mapwork II course and \nrequires the application of theoretical knowledge obtained in other courses throughout the Geological \nSciences curriculum, such as principles of rock and mineral identification, stratigraphic studies, petrology, \ngeochemistry and structural geology, as well as further developing 3-D visualisation, statistical, writing \nand graphicacy skills essential for geological reporting. This course involves a 10-day off-campus \nlithological and structural mapping excursion and a series of campus-based activities (underground tunnel \nmapping, mining-related structural geology exercises, supplementary petrological and geochemical \nlaboratory analysis of field samples, and introduction to field geophysical techniques).This course aims to \nfurther develop students' core field skills and advanced geological mapping techniques required by the \ngeosciences profession. \nThis includes interpretation of rock relationships and modes of formation of rock bodies, collection of \nspatial datasets and compilation of such datasets into summary documents such as logs of stratigraphic \nsections and geological maps, integrating fieldwork with laboratory analysis, and the ability to function \nproductively in a field setting with limited support facilities as well as with teams of people. This course is \nan apex-module in that it allows students to learn by integrating and applying their geological knowledge \nin a project-oriented manner in which they generate the observational and quantitative data necessary \nto solve a set of problems. It is, thus, close to the real-world situations they can expect once they are \nemployed as geologists. Assessment is both summative and developmental, and includes both individual \nand group tasks.",

    "Description": "This course is the study of matter and the changes that matter undergoes. It is often considered to be the \n\u2018central science\u2019 because of its importance to diverse areas of science and engineering. Chemistry draws \non the language of mathematics and the laws of physics to describe the world around us from a chemical, \nbiological and physical point of view. It plays a vital part in our understanding of the structure and the \ninteractions of matter, and it is crucial for a thorough understanding of disciplines as diverse as geology, \nmolecular biology, biotechnology, medicine, materials science and environmental studies. This course \ncovers the introductory aspects of chemistry essential for further studies towards a BSc in Chemistry or \ndegrees that require a general first-year background in the subject. Experimental work related to this \nmaterial, including quantitative analysis, will be carried out in the first year laboratories throughout the \nyear. \nSemester 1: Students are introduced to the concepts of matter and measurement; atoms, molecules \nand ions; stoichiometry and calculations with chemical formulas and equations. This is followed by a \nstudy of aqueous reactions, including acid-base reactions and solution stoichiometry. The fundamental \ndescription of matter from a chemistry point of view, including aspects such as, electronic structure of \natoms, periodic properties of the elements, basic concepts of chemical bonding, molecular geometry and \nbonding theories and the properties and theory of gases is then covered in some detail, followed by an \nintroduction to organic chemistry. \nSemester 2: Organic chemistry (including polymers and molecules of life); an introduction to coordination \ncompounds, intermolecular forces, liquids and solids and properties of solutions is given, followed by \nphysical chemistry topics such as thermochemistry, chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, chemical \nthermodynamics, electrochemistry and additional aspects of acid-base equilibria and aqueous equilibria.",

The course approaches this on two levels:  experimental studies and theoretical \nstudies. Theoretical analysis refers to model studies of isolated entities like single atoms or molecules, \ndiscussed in the basics of quantum mechanics. Statistics is used to link the two sets of results and the \nprocedure is commonly known as statistical thermodynamics. This course first introduces the candidate \nto numerical approaches to solving complex mathematical problems that may be useful in chemistry and \na study of the symmetry of molecules, known as group theory. The course then covers the fundamentals \nand applications of quantum theory and statistical thermodynamics.",

In fact, the gamma-ray spectral range alone covers more decades \nin energy or frequency compared to the eleven decades in energy covered between radio waves \nand hard X-rays alone. There are several ways to probe high-energy processes: through the direct \nmeasurement of high-energy particles, or cosmic rays, and the direct measurement of non-thermal \nemission in the radio, optical, X-rays up to the gamma-ray range. In the case of pulsars, we find that \nthis emission is associated with rapidly rotating neutron stars, which accelerate charged particles as a \nresult of the dynamo processes. Particle acceleration occurs in our galaxy, as well as in extragalactic \nobjects. This course covers the fundamental principles of this process in a few types of cosmic sources. \nThose accelerated particles, which escape from a source, finally contribute to the bulk of cosmic \nrays in our galaxy, and some of these particles are detectable at Earth. The second part of the course \nconcentrates on neutron stars and pulsars: Emphasis is given in their properties, observable phenomena, \ntheir gamma-ray emission.",

In the present connected world with \nhuge amounts of digital information to be transmitted all the time and in all directions, encoding has to be\ndone as efficiently as possible with regard to reducing transmission time and storage space. Information \ntheory is a key tool in achieving this goal. The course highlights the fundamental role of the statistical \nconcept of entropy in information theory and presents some of the most efficient coding schemes. Since \nchannels for transmission of information are usually subject to noise, errors may occur. Hence, reliable \ntransmission requires encoding schemes which allow for error detection and error correction. This is the \ncore subject of coding theory. Another reason for encoding is secrecy (But this is the subject of cryptology \nand is not considered in this course). The mathematical statistics basis of this course is probability theory, \ndiscrete random variables, homogeneous Markov chains, and matrix calculus.",

Any candidate in physics should have some exposure to the ideas and methods of \nquantum field theory. The course starts by quantising the free scalar field, following an intuitive approach. \nThis result is then reproduced, first by using standard canonical quantisation and then by using the path \nintegral formulation. Wick's theorem is derived using both formulations. Interacting theories are then \nstudied and the Feynman rules are introduced. The usual UV infinities that plague perturbative treatments \nof quantum field theory are exhibited and the renormalisation procedure is explained. Renormalised \nperturbation theory is used to renormalise the theory to one loop. Regularisation methods are introduced \nto accomplish this. The same problem is studied, using Wilson's renormalisation group formalism. The \ncourse ends with a derivation of the Callan-Symanzik equation as well as a computation of one loop \nanomalous dimensions and beta functions.",

    "Description": "This course is a branch of Geophysics that deals with the mechanical vibrations of the Earth caused by \nnatural sources, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and controlled sources, such as underground \nexplosions. Seismic waves are analysed to study the mechanisms of earthquakes, the structure and \nevolution of the Earth's core, mantle and crust, and the effect of shaking on structures such as buildings \nand mines. Seismological methods are used to explore for minerals and hydrocarbons; support the design, \nconstruction and operation of facilities such as mines, dams, nuclear power stations and waste disposal \nsites; and mitigate the risks posed by earthquakes. \nThe Seismology course covers: a review of relevant topics in mathematics, signal processing, physics \n(especially the properties and propagation of mechanical waves) and geology; the causes and effects of \nnatural and mining-induced earthquakes, including methods to assess seismic hazard and mitigate risks; \nthe acquisition, processing and interpretation of refraction and reflection seismic surveys; and imaging of \nthe crust and mantle using teleseismic sources. 217",

Such systems are thermodynamic in nature which can absorb, store, transport andexpel energy. Astrophysical thermodynamics studies the laws and processes that govern the transportof energy in astrophysical systems. Radiation is an important mechanism for the transport of energythrough both matter and empty space. The theory of radiative processes studies the laws and mechanismsresponsible for the generation of radiation, its interaction with matter and the transport of energy.",

The course includes the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, composite extensions and simple \nextensions, the Galois group of polynomials, solvability and radical extensions leading to the result on the \ninsolvability of the quintic. Finite dimensional Vector Spaces.\nThe purpose of this course is to treat linear transformations on finite dimensional vector spaces by simple \ngeometric notions common to many parts of mathematics and in a language that is used in the theory of \nintegral equations and Hilbert Theory. The course builds on t`he elementary notions of vectors spaces\nover fields and introduces dual spaces, quotient spaces and the direct sum of vector spaces. Central to \nthe development is the introduction of bilinear forms and inner products and the Riesz Representation \nTheorem with the ideas of adjoint and self-adjoint linear transformations.

In many astrophysical systems, the mean free path of its \nconstituents is small compared with the size of the system. These systems can be modelled as fluid. Such \nsystems are thermodynamic in nature which can absorb, store, transport and expel energy. Astrophysical \nthermodynamics studies the laws and processes that govern the transport of energy in astrophysical \nsystems. Radiation is an important mechanism for the transport of energy through both matter and empty \nspace. The theory of radiative processes studies the laws and mechanisms responsible for the generation \nof radiation, its interaction with matter and the transport of energy.",

Students are also introduced to the fundamentals of nonlinear optimization theory and methods. \nSome basic algorithms are presented and studied to provide some flavour of this important aspect of \noptimization. Seeking solutions to optimal control problems whenever closed-form solutions exist will \nalso be investigated, where students will learn to mathematically model optimal control problems arising \nfrom practical applications, and numerically obtain solutions to those problems.",
