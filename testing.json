There is \n extensive coverage of Structured Query Language (SQL) and database instance \n tuning. Students learn about the advanced object-relational features in DBMS \n such as Oracle, including navigational query, BLOBs and abstract data \n types. OUTCOMES Students should be able to: gain good understanding \n of relational data model in terms of data structure, data \n integrity, and data manipulation; create and understand conceptual database models \n utilising entity-relationship modelling; design data structures that will limit redundancy \n and enforce data integrity while conforming to organisational requirements utilising \n normalisation methodology; understand the theory behind the relational data model \n as it applies to interactions with current database management systems; \n read and interpret a given data model to query the \n database and transform the data into information using Structured Query \n Language; implement a data model in a current relational database \n management system; and create reports, based on transactional data, including elements such as data groupings and summary values.

CBE.323 TAXATION PLANNING Taxation Planning 2A \n and 2B are couplet modules The definition of couplet modules \n is two modules in a specified year, whereby the second \n module builds upon the first module. The passing mark of \n each module is usually 50%, but a student who did \n not obtain the required 50% in the first module but \n obtained for this module a minimum mark of 40% in \n the last assessment opportunity (exam) and a final mark of \n at least 40%, will be granted entry to the second \n module. To obtain credit for both modules, the second module \n must be passed and an average of 50% for both \n modules has to be obtained by the student. Credit can \n be obtained for the second module if a final mark \n of 50% is obtained for this module, and not an \n average of 50% for both modules. If the first module \n is repeated while a credit has already been obtained for \n the second module, the first module must be passed on \n its own. A student who qualifies for a supplementary assessment on a couplet module and obtained a last assessment opportunity mark (exam mark) of at least 40% can choose if he/she wants 671to write the supplementary or retain credit on the original final mark. Should he/she choose to write the supplementary assessment, but fail the module; the highest mark between the original and supplementary assessment mark will be used to retain the credit.",

To this end students, encounter topics that encompass three \n inter-related explanatory approaches, namely biological, e.g. the role of the \n brain in human behaviour; psychological, e.g. cognition, motivation, and emotion; \n and environmental explanations, e.g. socio-cultural influences. 718OUTCOMES Students should be \n able to: explain the nature and origins of psychology and \n critically differentiate between the major perspectives associated with the field \n of psychology; describe the nature of scientific psychology, including ethical \n issues, and be able to differentiate between major research strategies; \n discuss the role of biological factors in human functioning; describe \n the processes of sensation and perception and evaluate the role \n of these processes in everyday functioning; and differentiate between various states of consciousness and the implications of these states for human functioning.",
