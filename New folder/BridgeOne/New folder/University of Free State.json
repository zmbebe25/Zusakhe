The first \npart of this module focuses on the three main actions avail able in the law \nof delict as well as the five elements required to establish delictual liability. \nDelictual remedies, joint wrongdoers and specific delicts, including third \nparty compensation, are covered in the second part. The development of \nthis area of  law in the South African constitutional dispensation and the \nreconcilability thereof with the indigenous law are also investigated.  \nOn completion of this module, the student will be able to:  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Critically discuss and apply the foundational principles of th e law of \ndelict within the South African legal system.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Reflect on the values, the history and the dynamic nature of the law\nof delict.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Analyse relevant case law to illustrate how the law of delict has \ntransformed in line with the Constitution.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Reflect on t he influence of the law of delict, as transformed by the \nConstitution, on access to justice and the enhancement of social \njustice and compare the current position with the previous \ndispensation.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Investigate the development, current position and rules of \napplication of a specific delict in South Africa in comparison with the \nposition in another country, for example, psychological lesions in \nSouth Africa in comparison with the position in the United Kingdom.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Identify the specific sections of the Constitution which impact on the \nlaw of delict, investigate and explain the reconcilability of the \ncommon law and more specific, the law of delict, with the indigenous \nlaw as an equivalent, parallel and recognised legal system.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Independently analyse delictual disputes to determine whether the \ncases give effect to delictual claims.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Provide clear, organised and chronological arguments to solve \ndefined and unfamiliar delictual law problems in written formats that \nare required in practice (for example, a written legal opin ion or heads \nof argument) and by making use of available information technology \nto conduct research.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Critically discuss different concept s in the law of delict with reference \nto case law, by conducting proper research and utilising appropriate \nterminology with due regard for agency and accountability in a \nprofessional occupation.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Solve basic calculations of apportionment of damages based on \ndelictual principles regarding liability.  \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Calculate the damages and prescription period with regards to third \nparty c ompensation claims and lodge a claim on behalf of a client \nwith the Road Accident Fund.",
