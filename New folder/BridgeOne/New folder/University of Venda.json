UNIT2: The theoretical\nunderpinning of physical sciences. Looking at science as a discipline and Physical science as a subject.\nWhy do we teach Physical sciences? What are the domains of teaching thrusts? Planning from the point\nof view of work scheduling and then lesson plans. UNIT 3 Issues in the teaching and learning of\nphysical sciences, constructivism is considered and other approaches like learning styles and the\nInformation processing model with regard to learning physical sciences are considered. UNIT 4 Physical\nscience outside the classroom: Field trips, tours etc. there is an integration of excursions, field trips,\neducational tours in a virtual and physical modes. With the proliferation of digital interactivity and the\nissue of having problems based on difficulties with the actual educational tours, digital could be better\nin some instances and hence introduced to the student teachers. UNIT 5 Laboratory experiences and\nassessment, goals of laboratory experience, school laboratory safety. Here we also have, physical and\ndigital manipulatives being used. Computer simulations are used in addition to laboratory equipment\nand experimentation. Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement for Physical sciences is used\nthroughout the module. UNIT 6 Recent developments in technology and teaching relevant to physical\nsciences teaching. Aspects of technology that lead to greater teaching and learning are handled in this",

This module is designed to introduce students to criminology as a study field within the social sciences. Criminological concepts such as crime, criminology, the role of a criminologist, the profile of an offender, victim, as well as the victim-perpetrator relationship are examined. Since criminology is primarily concerned with an understanding of the causes of crime, the module examines some of the 26most influential explanations for criminal behaviour. Theories of crime causation and its distribution over time, place and social groups will be examined in this module. The different models of crime reduction comprising primary, secondary and tertiary as well as integrated approaches are introduced. The module further exposes students to an understanding of the role of the criminal justice institutions and processes entailed in the administration of justice.",

        "Description": "CRM 3141 is 12 credit third year module offered in the first semester. This module comprises of two units. The first unit deals with criminological theories and the second unit deals with victimological theories. The first unit of this module which is on criminological theories is designed to engage students in the process of summarising, critically evaluating and testing criminological theories. The module will import concepts from other disciplines in the social sciences to advance the testing of theories of crime. The module will enable students to write up an analysis and present their findings in class. The analysis and presentation will prepare students for an advanced criminological research module. The second unit of this module focuses on victimological theories to provide an advanced integrated study of victimisation. The module takes as its point of departure recent international developments and international protocols on victims’ rights and also examines specific patterns of victimisation. The interactions between crime victims and the justice system are further examined with a special focus on restorative justice and other indigenous justice approaches within the South African context. The student will be expected to critically analyse current as well as classical works in the area of victim service. This module applies the knowledge gained in the second-year module on Victimology by conducting case studies in which students are expected to examine the relationship between victim and offender during the victimisation process. A victim empowerment policy implementation assessment will be conducted experientially whereby students will engage in service-learning at a victim crime assistance agency of their choice and later submit a report on the agency’s functionality in victim assistance. Throughout the course the impact of differences on the basis of race, age, gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality and disability will be examined in theories and criminological application.",

Students will encounter a range of techniques within each of these methods. Students will examine these research methods and related challenges. The focus in qualitative research will be on techniques such as case studies, interviews, observations and ethnography, whereas quantitative research focuses on techniques such as questionnaires, surveys and other numerical data collection tools. During the lectures the final year students will also be exposed to case studies in which they will discuss in small groups the ethical and pragmatic considerations applicable in the various research methods and the methodological framework for approaching a research problem. Furthermore, students are expected to gain a full appreciation of the important role of research ethics in criminological research, including issues of consent, confidentiality, privacy and storage of data.",

Jurisprudence is the philosophy or theory of law and as a subject, it overlaps with sister disciplines in the social sciences such as philosophy, politics, sociology, economics, anthropology and so on. It is devoted to the study of thoughts about the nature of law, and this module explores the thinking of legal philosophers about law, from classical natural law theory to contemporary legal positivists. The module covers the different theories of law: natural law, legal positivism, American and Scandinavian legal realism, historical legal theory, African legal philosophy. The module also introduces students to more contemporary critical movements in jurisprudence particularly, critical legal studies, feminist legal theory, and the Third World approach to international law (TWAIL). In exploring the two fundamental themes of Jurisprudence—Theories of Law and Theories of Justice — the module contextualises the subject in a South African setting and its relevance in addressing “hard cases” in selected contemporary issues of society including protests, religion, euthanasia, abortion, the death penalty, sexual orientation, xenophobia: entrenching the rule of law and the transformative constitutionalism enterprise. The module also examines the evolving phenomenon of “e-justice” and the impact of ICT on the traditional conception of justice.",

        "Description": "This is the module which builds on Intermediate Microeconomics to complete the typical dose in microeconomics analysis. Three major aspects are covered, namely, the Theory of Market Structures, the Nature of General Equilibrium and Welfare Economics. Graphical approaches and algebraic manipulations are typical tools of analysis. The intended learning outcomes are a working knowledge of topics in current microeconomic research, and the ability to formulate and solve formal models in microeconomic theory. Included in this course are welfare theorems, intrahousehold welfare and marriage markets.",

Special attention is given to developing countries and other small open economies under the Mundell- Fleming model. A major overall theme is the implication of increased integration of global financial markets. Another is countries’ choice of monetary regime, especially the degree of exchange rate flexibility and alternative ways that central banks can credibly commit to noninflationary policy. Implications of financial and currency crises in emerging markets will be covered.",

They must also be able to read, modify and write Code, so that they can assemble the computational tools needed to solve their data-analysis problems, rather than customizing problems to fit tools provided by others. At the heart of this course, students will learn the core of ideas of programming functions, objectives, data structures, flow control, input and output, debugging, logical design and abstraction. In the context of Statistics and data analysis through writing Code to assist in numeric and graphical statistical analyses. Students will, in particular, learn how to write maintainable Code, and to test Code for correctness.
