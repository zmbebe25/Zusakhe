Upon completion, students should be able to demonstrate a sophisticated grasp of the theories, debates, ideas and practices of rural development. We seek to not only achieve high levels of scholarship but endeavor to provide students with academic tools \u2013 including research, analytical, presentation, and writing skills \u2013 and knowledge that will potentially transform the way we think and act on agrarian issues.",
    "Content": "The course is driven by a few questions: What are the theoretical underpinnings of key rural development strategies and policies? What is the nature of the rural economy in south Africa? How do we restructure rural agriculture to generate sustainable livelihoods? What is the state of non-farm economic activity in the rural areas? What is the role of technology and genetic engineering? How is land reform related to rural development? What conditions lead to viable economic activities in rural areas? We will cover relevant theoretical paradigms and concepts (food security, food sovereignty, class dynamics, agrarian history, sustainability, off-farm employment, rural tourism, etc).",
