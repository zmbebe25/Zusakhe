Content will be assessed in 4 theory-based question papers, an Anatomy Spotter and an OSCE. The discipline-based content is as follows: i. Anatomy of the organs/systems mentioned ii. Physiology of the organs/systems mentioned iii. Anatomical Pathology of the organs/systems mentioned iv. Integrated multidisciplinary paper (weighted at 25% each) To pass the module the student must obtain 50% for the EME, with a sub-minimum of 50% in the OSCE. The final module mark of a student who writes the EME will be the average of the EME mark and the class mark. Exemption from Final Examination (EME): A student may be exempted from the EME by virtue of having obtained at least 65% in each ETT. Such a student will further need to have obtained a sub-minimum of 50% in each of the components of each ETT, i.e., Anatomy, Physiology, Anatomical Pathology, and the Multidisciplinary component as detailed above. Any student who fulfils the above criteria may apply for exemption from sitting for the written component of the End of Module Examination (EME) within three (3) days after the last ETT (release of marks). This exemption does not include the OSCE component. The final module mark of a student who is exempted from the EME will be calculated by adding the weighted average of the class mark to the OSCE mark, in a proportion of 90% to 10%.This exemption does not negate the DP requirements for the module."

Underpinning this paper, the student is expected to show reflection on a clinical practice towards formulation of a research question to implement EBN practice. The paper should also draw on the importance, purpose, current challenges, limitations and biases relating to EBN from a reflective standpoint of the student. Assignment 2 (Data Search) 20% In this assignment the student is expected to present an appropriate refined researchable practice question, engage with relevant data sources for relevant appropriate literature, use of the PICO strategy and appraisal of the literature. This assignment is in the form of a seminar presentation. The student will demonstrate communication skills through presentation of the search strategy to other learners and also demonstrate an understanding of the process through engagement with critique and questions from peers. Proposed Plan and Seminar Presentation (Application and Evaluation of Evidence) 30 % In this assignment, the student will discuss the nature of evidence, the interface of the clients personal preference and context when considering the appraised literature. The student will also present an action plan of how the appraised and graded evidence on the selected nursing practice topic will be applied practically. The seminar will also discuss the inherent responsibilities of a nurse researcher in terms of accountability and ethics underpinning EBN practice.
