In particular philosophy equips students with analytical\nreasoning skills necessary to understand and solve complex moral problems related to economic and political\ndecision making. We demonstrate to students how the most important questions concerning the socio-economic\naspects of our lives can be broken down and illuminated through reasoned debate. Examples of themes which\nmay be covered in the module include justice and the common good, a moral consideration of the nature and\nrole of economic markets on society, issues concerning justice and equality, and dilemmas of loyalty. The works\nof philosophers covered may for instance include that of Aristotle, Locke, Bentham, Mill, Kant, Rawls, Friedman,\nNozick, Bernstein, Dworkin, Sandel, Walzer, MacIntyre, Bujo, Wiredu, and Gyekye. In the second quarter of the\nmodule the focus is on professionalism, careers and ethics. Codes of ethics in business and professions,\nprofessional codes, as well as ethical issues in the accountancy profession are discussed.",

To lay the foundation on which the rest of the module can follow, traditional\nweb-based programming languages such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS and Python will be covered differentiating\nbetween client-side and server-side computation.  Persistence of web-based data will be included for both client\nand server-based computation.  These technologies will be extended and applied to mobile platforms where the\navailability of a connection, location-services and mobile device limitations play a role.  For cloud platforms,\naspects relating to task partitioning, security, virtualisation, cloud storage and access to the shared data stores,\ndata synchronisation, partitioning and replication are considered. In order to practically demonstrate that a\nstudent has reached these outcomes, students will be required to use, integrate and maintain the necessary\nsoftware and hardware by completing a number of smaller practical assignments where after integrating all\nthese technologies into a comprehensive and practical programming project is required.",

    "Description": "The focus of this module is on a formal approach to deriving algorithms, known as correctness by construction.\nIt relies on Dijkstra's guarded command language (GCL) for specifying the derived algorithms. The requirements\nof an algorithm are initially stated in terms of a pre- and a post-condition, specified in first order predicate logic.\nStrategies are given for progressively refining these specifications to GCL notation which can, in turn, easily be\ntranslated into a conventional programming language. The surprising power of the method will be\ndemonstrated. Not only are algorithms guaranteed to be correct (in the same sense that the proof of a\nmathematical theorem is guaranteed to be correct); they frequently turn out to be remarkably efficient. In the\nearly part of the module, a number of well-known algorithms (such as linear and binary search, raising a number\nto an integer power, finding the approximate log of a number, etc) will be derived in order to become thoroughly\nfamiliar with the approach. Later various intermediate level algorithms will be derived (such as simple raster\ndrawing algorithms, pattern matching algorithms, finding the longest string of a certain type, an algorithm to\nsolve the majority voting problem, etc).

The\nmodule starts by developing an equivalent circuit model of basic magnetic circuits through the study of flux, flux\ndensity, reluctance, hysteresis and MMF, which is later used to study and analyse electro-mechanical conversion\nsystems. The module then moves to modelling single and three-phase transformers by introducing a\nfundamental electrical engineering tool, the per-unit system, as well as voltage regulation and efficiency in\nanalysing the equivalent circuit model. Before modelling rotating machines, the fundamental principles thereof,\nincluding torque, speed, efficiency and heat loss, are introduced. Two rotating machines models are developed\nand studied: three-phase induction motors and DC motors. The equivalent models are used to analyse the\nperformance of the machines.",

    "Description": "Soil chemistry is the study of the chemical behaviour (precipitation, dissolution, sorption, oxidation, reduction,\nvolatilization etc.) of elements and compounds in the soil. Soil exerts a control on nutrient availability and\ntherefore on nutrient cycling (for example the soil-plant system). The growing anthropogenic pressure on soil\nand the larger environment means a fundamental understanding of the behaviour of pollutants is an\nincreasingly important skill set required by industry. In this module we will look at the soil solution chemistry,\nmineral solubility, redox chemistry, as well as the chemistry at the surface of soil minerals, of a wide range of\nnutrients and pollutants. Soil acidification, weathering and associated chemicalmineralogical transformation, as\nwell as landscape dynamics of carbon, iron and manganese receive special attention in this module. ",

Critical questions are posed about modern selfhood, sociality, culture and identity against the\nbackground of new communications technologies, ever more multicultural societies, enduring gender, class and\nrace inequities, and the emergence of new and the resurgence of older forms of social and political identity.\nThese issues are approached from the vantage of our location in southern Africa and the continent, drawing on\nsocial science perspectives.",

The aim is to extend and consolidate knowledge of basic\nengineering disciplines and apply this in an integrated and synthesised way on classic design applications. The\nstudent is exposed to all the applications of the classic disciplines of structures, geotechnical, hydraulics and\ntransportation and compiles a preliminary design. The various discipline specialists select relevant application\nexamples in each discipline for detail designs such as: \nStructures: Multi storey buildings with reinforced concrete frames and slabs; bridge across a river or road. \nHydraulics: Pump stations and rising main; hydrological analysis and flood line study. \nGeotechnical: Slimes dams; high embankments. \nTransportation: Traffic impact studies, pavement design and analysis.\nThe applications selected for each discipline may vary from year to year.",

Questions on the nature of social interaction in communities, changing\nways of relating, inequality and livelihoods, collective action, local cultures and modernities are considered. With\nmigration to the city spurred by the communication revolution, the city has become a source of aspirations and\nillusions. A key issue in place-space configurations is the dialectic between citizenship and cosmopolitanism\n(aligned to individualism and multiple identities), on the one hand, and the experience of community (aligned to\na collectivity) on the other hand. The debate on who belongs to the city highlights both symbolic and material\nissues and a politics around access to rights and resources, and therefore a possibility of mobilisation.\nContemporary themes such as informality, different forms of local participation and consumption are considered.",

In this respect the assumptions and processes\nunderpinning methodological choices in sociological research are considered in order to think about foundations\nof research, about how knowledge claims are made, how science is conceptualised, what role theory plays, as\nwell as how values and ethics shape the politics of research. In addition to these foundational questions, a broad\nintroduction to methods used in social research is provided by considering both the theoretical dimensions and\npractical application of various research tools. The purpose of the module is to equip students with the\nnecessary competence to, describe ontological and epistemological debates and different approaches to\nresearch in the social sciences, delineate a research problem, identify units of analysis, make sampling decisions\nand formulate questions and hypothesis as well as understand the principles of quantitative (elementary\nstatistical decision-making) and qualitative data analysis.",

Understanding how various\nbiotic and abiotic factors affect plant metabolic processes, including photosynthesis and respiration. Emphasis is\nplaced on the efficiency of the mechanisms whereby C3-, C4 and CAM-plants bind CO2 and how they are\nimpacted by the environment. To understand the functioning of plants in diverse environments, the relevant\nstructural properties of plants, the impact of soil composition, water flow in the soil-plant air continuum and long\ndistance transport of assimilates will be discussed. Students will research a topic relevant to plant ecophysiology\nand present this in the form of an oral presentation. Students will conduct a practical project to study the effects\nof environmental factors on C3 and C4 plant growth and physiology. Students will present the report in a written\nformat according to the guidelines of a relevant scientific journal. Relevant readings will be used to highlight the\nalignment of the module with the Sustainable Development Goals, with emphasis placed on climate action.",

Certain aspects of natural product chemistry i.e. the biosynthesis,\necological role and toxicity of the three main classes of secondary compounds; terpenoids, phenolics, and\nalkaloids are discussed. An introduction to the principles and applications of metabolomics is presented. The role\nof these natural products in defense against microorganisms and herbivores is reviewed during the module. The\nimportance of ethnobotany and phylogenetics in modern drug discovery from biodiversity will presented along\nwith legal and ethical considerations surrounding bioprospecting. This will follow on with modern theories and\npractices regarding sustainable utilisation and conservation of medicinal plants. The basics of alternative\nmedicines, with an emphasis on traditional African and Chinese medicines, are also discussed as well as current\nevidence-based research and product development derived from these. Biotechnological approaches to\nmedicinal natural product production, 'farmer to pharma', will be covered, including plant cell culture and\nbioreactors. Practical sessions on drug discovery approaches using chromatographic techniques for\nphytochemical analysis of secondary metabolites such as tannins, alkaloids, and saponins are conducted.\nBioassays on micro-organisms are also done during the practical sessions in order to develop the skills for the\npotential discovery of new antibiotics.",

Attention is\ngiven to important concepts and approaches in professional ethics and to suitable methods in moral problem\nsolving. A number of major issues engineers are confronted with are also dealt with: What does it take to be a\nresponsible and honest engineer? To what extent does the engineer have the obligation to avoid risks and\npromote safety? How should engineers solve the tension between their professional obligations and\nexpectations employers have? How far does the responsibility of engineers for the natural environment go? How\ncan engineers act morally responsibly in an international context? During discussion classes a number of case\nstudies illustrating these moral issues are thoroughly analysed.",

Using\nactors/models, students are taught the application of the Advanced trauma life support (ATLS) (ABCDE) type\napproach to trauma.\nThe trauma theory comprises the introduction to the full spectrum of trauma as a disease. Epidemiology of\ntrauma, mechanisms of wounding, including ballistics, the biological response to trauma, wound healing and\ncomplications of trauma will be taught. Emergency treatment, resuscitation and intensive care treatment of the\ntrauma victim will be covered.\nA systematic course on a thematic basis will be given to cover the major organ systems prioritised according to\nthe ATLS type approach of life threatening, limb threatening or disfiguring injuries.\nThus, thoracic, cardiovascular, abdominal, head and neck trauma will be dealt with as potential life threatening\ninjuries, orthopaedic as limb threatening trauma and skin injuries are mainly disfiguring. Thermal, electrical and\nchemical burns and hypothermia will be covered. Introduction to physical and psychological rehabilitation and\nnutrition of the trauma victim will be taught.",

In order to achieve this, the student must know the embryology, normal\nanatomy, histology and functions of the periodontium. The student must understand the aetiology,\npathogenesis, the risk and other factors associated with the various forms of periodontal diseases, and their\nclassification. The student must be able to perform a comprehensive clinical examination and use the\ninformation so gained to arrive at a diagnosis and treatment plan. The student must become proficient in\napplying preventive control methods, to supply oral hygiene methods and applicable instructions to the patient;\nmotivating the patient; scaling and root planning; be able to correctly evaluate the tissue response to these\nprocedures; be able to differentiate clinically between the various forms of periodontal disease and be able to\nperform clinical procedures associated with the treatment of early and moderate stages of periodontal diseases.\nThe student must understand the treatment possibilities associated with established and advanced periodontal\ndiseases, including regenerative procedures and implant treatment, and when and to whom, such patients\nshould be referred for specialist diagnosis and treatment, should this be necessary.",
