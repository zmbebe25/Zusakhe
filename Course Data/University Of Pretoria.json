In particular philosophy equips students with analytical\nreasoning skills necessary to understand and solve complex moral problems related to economic and political\ndecision making. We demonstrate to students how the most important questions concerning the socio-economic\naspects of our lives can be broken down and illuminated through reasoned debate. Examples of themes which\nmay be covered in the module include justice and the common good, a moral consideration of the nature and\nrole of economic markets on society, issues concerning justice and equality, and dilemmas of loyalty. The works\nof philosophers covered may for instance include that of Aristotle, Locke, Bentham, Mill, Kant, Rawls, Friedman,\nNozick, Bernstein, Dworkin, Sandel, Walzer, MacIntyre, Bujo, Wiredu, and Gyekye. In the second quarter of the\nmodule the focus is on professionalism, careers and ethics. Codes of ethics in business and professions,\nprofessional codes, as well as ethical issues in the accountancy profession are discussed.",

To lay the foundation on which the rest of the module can follow, traditional\nweb-based programming languages such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS and Python will be covered differentiating\nbetween client-side and server-side computation.  Persistence of web-based data will be included for both client\nand server-based computation.  These technologies will be extended and applied to mobile platforms where the\navailability of a connection, location-services and mobile device limitations play a role.  For cloud platforms,\naspects relating to task partitioning, security, virtualisation, cloud storage and access to the shared data stores,\ndata synchronisation, partitioning and replication are considered. In order to practically demonstrate that a\nstudent has reached these outcomes, students will be required to use, integrate and maintain the necessary\nsoftware and hardware by completing a number of smaller practical assignments where after integrating all\nthese technologies into a comprehensive and practical programming project is required.",

Students\nwill develop a detailed understanding of the confidentiality service by focusing on cryptology and the practical\nimplementation thereof. The student will be introduced to professional and philosophical ethics. At the end of\nthe module students will be able to engage in a debate regarding the impact (local and global) of computers on\nindividuals, organisations and society. The professionalism of IT staff will be discussed against national and\ninternational codes of practices such as those of the CSSA, ACM and IEEE.",

The requirements\nof an algorithm are initially stated in terms of a pre- and a post-condition, specified in first order predicate logic.\nStrategies are given for progressively refining these specifications to GCL notation which can, in turn, easily be\ntranslated into a conventional programming language. The surprising power of the method will be\ndemonstrated. Not only are algorithms guaranteed to be correct (in the same sense that the proof of a\nmathematical theorem is guaranteed to be correct); they frequently turn out to be remarkably efficient. In the\nearly part of the module, a number of well-known algorithms (such as linear and binary search, raising a number\nto an integer power, finding the approximate log of a number, etc) will be derived in order to become thoroughly\nfamiliar with the approach. Later various intermediate level algorithms will be derived (such as simple raster\ndrawing algorithms, pattern matching algorithms, finding the longest string of a certain type, an algorithm to\nsolve the majority voting problem, etc).

    "Description": "This module centres on converting a physical, electrical system into an equivalent electrical circuit model. The\nmodule starts by developing an equivalent circuit model of basic magnetic circuits through the study of flux, flux\ndensity, reluctance, hysteresis and MMF, which is later used to study and analyse electro-mechanical conversion\nsystems. The module then moves to modelling single and three-phase transformers by introducing a\nfundamental electrical engineering tool, the per-unit system, as well as voltage regulation and efficiency in\nanalysing the equivalent circuit model. Before modelling rotating machines, the fundamental principles thereof,\nincluding torque, speed, efficiency and heat loss, are introduced. Two rotating machines models are developed\nand studied: three-phase induction motors and DC motors. The equivalent models are used to analyse the\nperformance of the machines.",

PCB layout techniques, decoupling and bypass capacitors relating to digital circuits are\naddressed. At the end of the theory sessions students need to design a filter. The practical work over the last\ntwo days consists of implementing the filter designed as well as coding DAC, FIR, IIR and PWM for a DSP. The\nDAC, FIR, IIR and PWM are implemented in hardware/firmware and the results displayed on an oscilloscope. At\nthe end of the module each student will demonstrate a working system consisting of the developed firmware\nand hardware performing the required signal processing functions. Students will be informed by the Department\nif, for practical reasons, the module needs to be offered in a different time slot.",

Soil exerts a control on nutrient availability and\ntherefore on nutrient cycling (for example the soil-plant system). The growing anthropogenic pressure on soil\nand the larger environment means a fundamental understanding of the behaviour of pollutants is an\nincreasingly important skill set required by industry. In this module we will look at the soil solution chemistry,\nmineral solubility, redox chemistry, as well as the chemistry at the surface of soil minerals, of a wide range of\nnutrients and pollutants. Soil acidification, weathering and associated chemicalmineralogical transformation, as\nwell as landscape dynamics of carbon, iron and manganese receive special attention in this module. ",

    "Description": "This module aims to provide students with a working knowledge and skills to learn methods and techniques for\ncollecting, processing and analysing remotely sensed data. Throughout the module, emphasis will be placed on\nimage processing, image analysis, image classification, remote sensing and applications of remote sensing in\ngeographical analysis and environmental monitoring. The module is composed of lectures, readings, practical\nexercises research tasks and a project or assignments of at least 64 notional hours. In particular, the practical\nexercises and research tasks incorporate South African examples using satellite remotely-sensed data, as well\nas field spectral data measurements, to promote understanding of the state of land cover and land use types\n(e.g. spanning agricultural resources, water resources, urbanization) and how changes over time could impact\non the changing climate in accordance with the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.",

Critical questions are posed about modern selfhood, sociality, culture and identity against the\nbackground of new communications technologies, ever more multicultural societies, enduring gender, class and\nrace inequities, and the emergence of new and the resurgence of older forms of social and political identity.\nThese issues are approached from the vantage of our location in southern Africa and the continent, drawing on\nsocial science perspectives.",

A key issue in place-space configurations is the dialectic between citizenship and cosmopolitanism\n(aligned to individualism and multiple identities), on the one hand, and the experience of community (aligned to\na collectivity) on the other hand. The debate on who belongs to the city highlights both symbolic and material\nissues and a politics around access to rights and resources, and therefore a possibility of mobilisation.\nContemporary themes such as informality, different forms of local participation and consumption are considered.",

To understand the functioning of plants in diverse environments, the relevant\nstructural properties of plants, the impact of soil composition, water flow in the soil-plant air continuum and long\ndistance transport of assimilates will be discussed. Students will research a topic relevant to plant ecophysiology\nand present this in the form of an oral presentation. Students will conduct a practical project to study the effects\nof environmental factors on C3 and C4 plant growth and physiology. Students will present the report in a written\nformat according to the guidelines of a relevant scientific journal. Relevant readings will be used to highlight the\nalignment of the module with the Sustainable Development Goals, with emphasis placed on climate action.",

Certain aspects of natural product chemistry i.e. the biosynthesis,\necological role and toxicity of the three main classes of secondary compounds; terpenoids, phenolics, and\nalkaloids are discussed. An introduction to the principles and applications of metabolomics is presented. The role\nof these natural products in defense against microorganisms and herbivores is reviewed during the module. The\nimportance of ethnobotany and phylogenetics in modern drug discovery from biodiversity will presented along\nwith legal and ethical considerations surrounding bioprospecting. This will follow on with modern theories and\npractices regarding sustainable utilisation and conservation of medicinal plants. The basics of alternative\nmedicines, with an emphasis on traditional African and Chinese medicines, are also discussed as well as current\nevidence-based research and product development derived from these. Biotechnological approaches to\nmedicinal natural product production, 'farmer to pharma', will be covered, including plant cell culture and\nbioreactors. Practical sessions on drug discovery approaches using chromatographic techniques for\nphytochemical analysis of secondary metabolites such as tannins, alkaloids, and saponins are conducted.\nBioassays on micro-organisms are also done during the practical sessions in order to develop the skills for the\npotential discovery of new antibiotics.",
