      "Description": "The purpose of this module is to develop confident, competent, \n multi-skilled professional Business Analysts, who are capable of reducing organisational \n risk, and increasing organisational value from the deployment of technology-based \n solutions. Modern thinking now splits the analysis function and as \n a result, the traditional role of the Systems Analyst has \n evolved into two distinct new roles: that of the Business \n Analyst who often reports into the business, and the Solution \n or Application Architect, who is an IT specialist. The main \n focus of the BA is to elicit and document requirements \n for new business solutions that usually have a technology base. \n The core body of knowledge is defined in the emerging \n BABOK (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge) which is defined by \n the IIBA (International Institute of Business Analysis). This module does \n not teach a specific dogma and methodology. Its intention is \n to develop thinking, confident Business Analysts with a strong grounding \n in selected, representative tools and techniques and an awareness of \n different project and software lifecycles. OUTCOMES Students who successfully complete \n this module will be able to: understand the multi-skilled role \n and responsibilities of the modern professional Business Analyst; deliver presentations, \n run workshops and JAD sessions, and conduct interviews; have a \n strong problem-solving focus, and be able to think strategically about \n IT solutions; gather and document functional, informational and non-functional requirements; \n understand and be able to produce common BA artefacts, including business cases and functional specifications; and model processes, data, organisation and interfaces using strong modelling skills. 402",

Credit can be obtained for the \n second module if a final mark of 50% is obtained \n for this module, and not an average of 50% for \n both modules. If the first module is repeated while a \n credit has already been obtained for the 667second module, the \n first module must be passed on its own. A student \n who qualifies for a supplementary assessment on a couplet module \n and obtained a last assessment opportunity mark (exam mark) of \n at least 40% can choose if he/she wants to write \n the supplementary or retain credit on the original final mark. Should he/she choose to write the supplementary assessment but fail the module; the highest mark between the original and supplementary assessment mark will be used to retain the credit.",

      "Description": "The design and operation of chemical engineering operations \nrequires quantitative estimates of chemical, physical and phase \nproperties of streams containing pure components or mixtures. \nTo determine the required properties of these process streams \nrequire the extensive use of appropriate correlations or \ninterpolation and extrapolation of limited data. Consequently, \nchemical engineers must be well acquainted with the \nfundamentals of chemical thermodynamics and the manner in \nwhich it can be applied. Upon comp letion of this course the   \n \n  learner will be able to : a) Understand the theory of and evaluate \nproperties of real gases; b) Calculate heat effect in the reactors; \nc) Establish relationships amongst the various thermodynamics \nproperties; d) Develop fundamental property relations for \nhomogeneous fluid mixtures of variable compositions and derive \nequations applicable to mixtures of ideal gases and ideal \nsolutions; e) Understand the theory of systems of variable \ncomposition exhibiting non -ideal behaviour; f) Understand the \ntheory of vapou r/liquid phase behaviour and calculate \ntemperatures, pressures, and phase compositions for systems \nin vapour/liquid equilibrium (VLE) at low to moderate pressures; \ng) Calculate the maximum conversion and equilibrium product \ndistribution in reactors.  \nContent  Review of basics concepts: 1st law of thermodynamics Entropy, \nEntropy changes of an ideal gas, mathematical statement of 2 \nnd law, Entropy balance for open systems, 3rd law of \nThermodynamics. Properties of pure Fluid: PVT behavior of \nPure substances, Viral EOS, Cubic EOS, generalized \ncorrelations for gases and liquids. Heat Effects: Sensible heats \neffects, Latent Heats of pure substances, standard heats of \nreaction, formation, and combustion. Thermodynamics \nProperties of re al Fluids: Properties Relations for homogeneous \nphases, Residual Properties, Residual Properties by EOS, Two \nphase systems, generalized property correlations for gases. \nProperties of Mixtures: Introduction to VLE theory, theory of \nsolution thermodynamics, Applications, Heats of mixing \nAcquisition of the above knowledge and understanding is \nthrough a combination of lectures, tutorial classes, field visits, \nteamwork project, individual professional development project \nand industrial training. The course will be assessed by tests, \ntutorials and an examination.",

      "Description": "Applied Mechanics comprises two modules namely statics and \ndynamics.  A basic understanding and implementing of the \nprinciples in statics and dynamics are of the utmost importance \nthroughout an engineer's career. Statics focuses on the \nbehaviour of structu ral elements to statically applied external \nphysical forces and moments, thus covering simple structural \nmechanics.  It will improve the knowledge of the learner of the \nbasic principles involved in static forces applied to elements \nsuch as beams, columns a nd machine parts. Dynamics focuses \non the dynamic behaviour of mechanical systems when forces \nand moment are applied to them.  It will improve the knowledge \nof the learner to apply basic principles of mechanics in the \nanalysis of elementary structures and machines.  \nContent  Bending moment; shear force diagrams; relationships between \nload, shear force and bending moment; moment of inertia and \nother geometrical properties of sections; shear stress \ndistributions and shear flow; theory of curvature; differential \nequations for def lections of beams; moment area -method for \ndeflections and superposition for deflections; compression \nelements and struts. Combined stress due to axial loading and \nbending moment; balancing of masses.",

Primary Health Care addresses all aspects of health within the community. These aspects include healthcare education, health promotion, access to healthcare as well as related issues such as community welfare, psychological wellbeing as well as the prevention of disease. This subject will begin by introducing the rationale behind the PHC concept and walk the student through various modules detailing PHC implementation.

In the context of Emergency Medical Care, competence in clinical assessment and the diagnosing of patients in the pre - hospital and hospital environment forms an essential part of the education of Emergency Medical Care students. Such competence is learned most effectively by combining theoretical learning and simulated practical approaches with clinical practice in the \u201creal world\u201d of emergency care under the guidance and supervision of mentors and supervisors. Theoretical learning can never be effective in isolation, neither can practical ability. This module therefore allowed the student to participate and engage meaningfully in the clinical environment and in so doing assumed full responsibility for their own learning. Mentors within the hospital and pre - hospital setting provided the student with a learning environment in which they offered meaningful feedback to the student as well as comment thereon. The module served as an extremely important component in moulding/building the student's relationships/interacti ons as well as developed the understanding of the student's role within the hospital and pre - hospital environment",

This list will contain a subset of the diseases and disorders that the student covered in the General Pathology module. Accurate assessment, examination and integration of various signs and symptoms will assist the student in reaching possible provisional diagnoses, but also as it relates to patient care and related decision -making.

The purpose was, furthermore, to provide the student with theory as well as practical working tools with which to apply this knowledge to their individual lives in a practical and real way. The course was designed to develop the students personal monitoring and observation skills and to extend their interpersonal management abilities. The module was designed to extend the student&rsquo;s knowledge of substance abuse and the grieving process so that they are better able to understand the real dangers of ineffective stress relief and so that they can understand their own and other&rsquo;s natural reactions and processes related to death and dying.</p>",

For that reason, the psychiatric and mental health nurse facilitates the promotion of mental health by mobilization of resources within the individual/family/group/ communities' internal and external environment. The continuous interaction between the psychiatric and mental health nurse and the patient is an important resource in the facilitation of the patients' mental health. The psychiatric and mental health nurse needs facilitative communication skills that include all aspect</p><p>of verbal and non- verbal communication,</p><p>as well as empathy, unconditional acceptance, congruence and authenticity, to be able to utilize her/himself as a sensitive, therapeutic, professional source. By studying the etiology of mental illness and recognising signs and symptoms, the psychiatric and mental health nurse can nurse the patient as a whole (body, mind and spirit) to promote his/her mental health. The student utilises critical/analytical, problem-solving skills and reflective skills to assess the patient according to the DSM 5 and mobilise the necessary nursing interactions for the promotion of the mental health of the patient.</p>",
