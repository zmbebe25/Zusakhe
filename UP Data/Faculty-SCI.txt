admission to postgraduate study by means of the recognition of a prior learning pathway is the exception
rather than the rule.

Senate deems equivalent to, or higher than the examinations prescribed for a degree at the University,
which are set as a prerequisite for admission to a particular postgraduate study programme, or for the
admission of such a person as a research student; or
ii. in another manner has reached a standard of competence Senate considers adequate for the purposes of
postgraduate study or research at the University, as a student for a postgraduate degree, diploma or
certificate.

Transfer to the BSc (Actuarial and Financial Mathematics) degree programme
Transfers to the BSc (Actuarial and Financial Mathematics) degree are considered on application. Applications are
handled by Student Administration and you should contact them (nas.undergradhelp@up.ac.za). Applications are
not considered during the year, but at the start of each year once the complete academic record for the previous
year is available. Applications are generally approved when students meet the requirements specified below.
Final admission in all cases is dependent on the capacity of the programme.
Transfer from BSc (Mathematical Statistics) 02133274
Refer to the requirements under the Admission Requirements above.
Transfer from BSc Extended programme – Mathematical Sciences 02130016
In terms of the yearbook, “Admissions from the BSc – Extended programmes to the BSc (Actuarial and Financial
Mathematics) programmes will only be considered if students have passed all their first-year modules with an
average percentage of at least 60%, passed IAS 111 and achieved a minimum percentage of 60% for WTW 143
and WTW 153.” Note that the admission requirements for IAS 111 and FBS 112 are 60% for each of the first year
Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics modules i.e. WTW 133, WTW 143, WST 133 and WST 143.
Transfers from other programmes not included above
Students who meet the grade 12 admission requirements for BSc (Actuarial and Financial Mathematics) are
considered. The student’s complete tertiary academic record will be considered. The student should have taken
and passed the full credit load in the previous degree for the time the student spent doing that degree. Failed
and/or dropped modules will normally disqualify a student from transferring.
Further queries not resolved by the above information, contact the department by sending an email outlining
your query with your name and student number to actuarial@up.ac.za.

their BScAgric degree programme, may be admitted to a special examination.
2. If, subject to faculty regulations, there is an indication at the end of an academic year that a student qualifies
for a special examination in no more than the equivalent of 36 credits, and that such student can complete his
or her third study year if he or she is successful, the faculty may require such student to write a special
examination or examinations. If the student declines the offer, this may be taken into consideration with
regard to further residence accommodation and financial support by the University.
3. A student only qualifies for a special examination if he or she sat for the prescribed examination in the
preceding year of study.
4. In the case of a student who passes the module on the basis of the special examination, the result of the
special examination does not replace the failed mark of such a module on a student’s academic record and it
is recorded as an additional mark.
5. In order to continue with the next (final) year of study, the results of the special examination must be
submitted to the relevant faculty’s head of student administration. It must be noted that a special
examination is a once-off opportunity.

Module content
Cultural constructions of sex and sexuality are the primary building blocks of social organisation. Anthropological
discussions of sexuality tend to revolve around the various aspects of social organisation, such as the lifecycle,
gendered identities, and personhood. These discussions are informed by the cultural meanings we impute to
differences in biological sex and reproduction, and the ways in which these meanings influence social
organisation, personhood, and power. In this module, we will consider cultural constructions of sex and sexuality
as these inform certain aspects of social organisation such as kinship and marriage. We will attempt to develop
an anthropological perspective on the interplay between sex, culture and society. To this end, we will examine
the physiology of sexuality, and then consider different theoretical perspectives on human sexuality as reflected
in cross-cultural ethnographic case studies.

This module considers the colonial histories of anthropology in Africa and their impact on traditions of knowledge
production in the discipline to propose a decolonised anthropology. It does so by critically reflecting on old and
contemporary ethnographies from and about the African continent and pays particular attention to ethnographic
methods, politics of representation, reflexivity, power and identity as pertinent questions to establish a
decolonised anthropology. Students in this module are encouraged to imagine a decolonised anthropology in

This module will provide students with the skills to use biophysical information and data obtained by undertaking
a natural resource inventory. This will be supported by taught methods of critically evaluating data and
information obtained through assessment methodologies and an understanding of sampling design (choosing
reference sites, spatial replication) and monitoring methods (e.g. recording biomass vs vegetation cover vs
species richness; aspects of seed biology etc.). Through the additional understanding of ecological and
agricultural concepts (e.g. productivity, decomposition rate, carbon uptake, pollinator abundance, erosion
protection, dust reduction) students will acquire the skills to provide reclamation and restoration solutions to
land degradation challenges in South Africa.
A site visit or field trip during which students will get exposed to the realities of reclamation and restoration and
apply their knowledge and skills will be a compulsory component of this module.

Module content
This module presents an advanced treatment of critical topics in monetary economics and the models
economists use to investigate the interactions between real and monetary factors. It provides extensive
coverage of general equilibrium (DSGE) models, models of the short-run real effects of monetary policy, and
game-theoretic approaches to monetary policy. Among the topics covered are models of time consistency,
monetary policy operating procedures, interest rates and monetary policy.
Throughout, this module focuses on the implications of interest rate control for monetary policy. The module is
designed for advanced graduate students in monetary economics, economic researchers and economists
working in policy institutions and central banks.
The module includes discussions of empirical evidence on the new Keynesian model, inflation forecast targeting
models, optimal policies in forward-looking models, stability and the Taylor principle, and open economy new
Keynesian models. It explicitly treats policy analysis in new Keynesian models and their underlying DSGE
foundations for both a closed economy, a small open economy and a two-country world economy; the discussion
includes the derivation of the policy objective function, optimal commitment and discretionary outcome,
targeting rules and instrument rules.

necessary to understand and solve complex moral problems related to economic and political decision making.
We demonstrate to students how the biggest questions concerning the socio-economic aspects of our lives can
be broken down and illuminated through reasoned debate. Examples of themes which may be covered in the
module include justice and the common good, a moral consideration of the nature and role of economic markets
on society, issues concerning justice and equality, and dilemmas of loyalty. The works of philosophers covered
may for instance include that of Aristotle, Locke, Bentham, Mill, Kant, Rawls, Friedman, Nozick, Bernstein,
Dworkin, Sandel, Walzer, and MacIntyre.

In soil physics, the principles of physics, chemistry, engineering, and meteorology are applied to address
practical problems in agriculture, ecology, and engineering. This module provides an overview of the basics of
soil physical properties, followed by soil water properties and the relationship between soil water content and
potential. Next, the various processes in the soil are discussed, including heat flow, water flow, and solute
movement. To familiarize students with the use of models for planning and as a tool for reasoning, we will use
the HYDRUS model extensively in both practice and theory. This module integrates both theoretical and
computational elements to enhance the overall scientific, quantitative, and computer skills so as to provide: a) a
fundamental understanding of how water, solutes, and heat transfer in soils influence the physical environment
for agriculture, hydrology, and the environment; b) conceptual and practical tools to deal with agricultural,
hydrological, and environmental challenges.

Soil ultimately controls nutrient supply to plants and organisms. The health and resilience of biota are therefore
closely linked to the interaction between the pedosphere and the biosphere. This course deals with the
availability and uptake of macro and micro nutrients in the plant - microbial– soil system, nutrient deficiencies
and toxicities, as well as soil properties and soil environmental conditions that influence soil fertility and its
suitability to act as a growth medium. Practical work includes the laboratory evaluation of soil fertility and
greenhouse pot trials to investigate nutrient uptake as well as deficiencies and toxicities symptoms in plants.

Soil is a finite resource and with the global challenges we are facing, it is more important than ever to
understand and sustainably manage soil. Our daily lives are impacted by soil in several ways, including the food
we eat, the water we drink, and the environment we live in. In this Introductory Soils module, we will look at how
basic and more advanced abiotic and biotic soil properties impact us and the larger environment. We will also
examine the fundamental principles behind sustainable soil use management.

Module content
Soil chemistry is the study of the chemical behaviour (precipitation, dissolution, sorption, oxidation, reduction,
volatilization etc.) of elements and compounds in the soil. Soil exerts a control on nutrient availability and
therefore on nutrient cycling (for example the soil-plant system). The growing anthropogenic pressure on soil
and the larger environment means a fundamental understanding of the behaviour of pollutants is an
increasingly important skill set required by industry. In this module we will look at the soil solution chemistry,
mineral solubility, redox chemistry, as well as the chemistry at the surface of soil minerals, of a wide range of
nutrients and pollutants. Soil acidification, weathering and associated chemicalmineralogical transformation, as
well as landscape dynamics of carbon, iron and manganese receive special attention in this module.

Soil ultimately controls nutrient supply to plants and organisms. The health and resilience of biota are therefore
closely linked to the interaction between the pedosphere and the biosphere. This course deals with the
availability and uptake of macro and micro nutrients in the plant - microbial– soil system, nutrient deficiencies
and toxicities, as well as soil properties and soil environmental conditions that influence soil fertility and its
suitability to act as a growth medium. Practical work includes the laboratory evaluation of soil fertility and
greenhouse pot trials to investigate nutrient uptake as well as deficiencies and toxicities symptoms in plants.

This module focuses on the modelling of agricultural commodity markets, price determination, policy and trade.
The main objective is to provide the basic theoretical principles and skills for partial-equilibrium model building
and and opportunity to apply these skills. The approach will include:
1) Economic theory: The theoretical foundations of each modelling component of a typical commodity balance
sheet and set of prices will be emphasised in the design and specification of models; price formation and model
closure under alternative equilibrium pricing conditions
2) Applied research: Advanced steps in modelling will be emphasised. Throughout the module, applied
modelling research will be conducted and presented to gain experience with methods discussed in class. The
course applies economic theory and quantitative methods to analyse food and agricultural markets, price, trade
and policy issues. The module examines problem formulation, model structure, estimation, and model
evaluation applied to demand and supply and to trade and policy interventions.

This module deals with a community psychological perspective on human behaviour and psychological
interventions and also critically explores the contribution of various perspectives in psychology. The module
focuses on themes such as definitions of key concepts, principles and aims of community psychology, and the
role of the community psychologist as well as the impact of earlier thought frameworks on contemporary
perspectives. The implications of these ideas for practical initiatives focused on mental health in communities,
are discussed. The module further focuses on critical psychology. Critical psychology is an orientation towards
psychology that is critical towards the assumptions and practices of psychology as it is practiced in the
mainstream. It attempts to address power issues as they manifest in the practice of mainstream psychology.
The focus is on examining how the practice and theories of mainstream psychology contribute to these power
issues impacting on marginalised groups.

The production potential and quality of pastures as influenced by botanical composition, vegetation cover,
livestock grazing and browsing potential, soil chemical, physical and biological conditions in addition to other
important environmental processes are addressed. Pasture selection for different purposes and the importance
of pasture management requirements within a planned livestock fodder flow system are taught. Monitoring
pastures (both natural and cultivated) in different biomes of Southern Africa, through different assessment
techniques to understand the health, production potential and quality thereof is explained. The different
utilisation methods of pastures, as influenced by the livestock factor and their effects on the pastures regrowth
potential, in addition to soil quality aspects are important principles that determine the value of pastures. The
evaluation of grasses and other vegetation types in terms of adaptation, acceptability and adaptability to
environmental and management conditions are important to an integrated and adaptive pasture and livestock
production system.

the ways in which evolution shapes the physiological processes that determine the energy, water and nutrient
fluxes between animals and their environments. Topics covered include: (i) circulation, gas exchange and
excretion; (ii) nutritional ecology; (iii) osmoregulation and thermoregulation; and (iv) reproductive physiology.
The major focus of this module is to understand the major sources of physiological diversity, namely scaling,
phylogenetic inertia, adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, and applying this knowledge to conceptually link
physiological processes at the cellular level to macrophysiological patterns at a global scale. Many examples
used in this module are directly relevant to the sustainable development goals of Good Health and Well-being,
Sustainable Cities and Communities, Climate Action and Life on Land.
