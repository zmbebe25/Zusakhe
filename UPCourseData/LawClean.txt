Module content
This module is an introduction to the Law and Sustainable Development discipline. Using a “systems” approach,
the module exposes students to the complexities of development given globalisation, the separation of powers,
and international public interest / human rights law. Three core subsystems (politics, economics and law) are
considered, to make the case for a multidisciplinary but integrated development model. In this model, the law,
judiciary and legal practitioners play a primary role to galvanise and shape development policy and a secondary
role to redress infractions and omissions. Students will consider development in a post-WWII context and the
paradigms that have shaped the thinking, policies, programmes and practices adopted by nation states to
advance the aspirations and legal obligations set out in international, regional and national human rights
instruments. The module content includes:
Development in a Post-World War II contexta.

Module content
Invitation to Sociology
How do we understand ourselves as individuals in relation to society? How are our individual life courses and
large-scale processes of social and historical change related to each other? How have our societies come to be
what they are today? And how can we think of our private troubles as public issues? These questions are at the
very heart of sociology as a distinctive way of thinking about and understanding the social worlds that we
inhabit. This module invites students to become familiar with sociological ways of thinking about current issues
and personal experiences (particularly in the southern African context), and to develop the analytical skills that
are necessary in order to ask and answer critical questions about the communities, society, and world that they
live in. The module will include a specific emphasis on academic reading skills.

Thinking sociologically
Drawing from the idea of Sociology as a discipline that focuses on critical thinking, the module will introduce
students to ways of questioning the obvious and the taken-for-granted. In particular, power and inequality will
be problematised, with a focus on how power operates to structure racial, class and gender inequalities across
institutions, ideologies and identities. The module will introduce students to the operations of power as
manifested in the production of institutions, the proliferation of identities and heightened contestations among
ideologies. The module will include a specific emphasis on writing skills.
