They must also be able to read, modify and write code, so that they can assemble the computational tools needed to solve their data-analysis problems, rather than customizing problems to fit tools provided by others. At the heart of this course, students will learn the core of ideas of programming functions, objectives, data structures, flow control, input and output, debugging, logical design and abstraction. In the context of Statistics and data analysis through writing code to assist in numeric and graphical statistical analyses. Students will, in particular, learn how to write maintainable code, and to test code for correctness.
